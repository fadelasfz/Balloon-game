**Game instructions**

This game is about finding the breaking point of several balloons, i.e. the maximum number of times the balloon can be pumped without bursting.
For example, if a balloon bursts when pumped 15 times, but remains whole when pumped 14 times, the balloon's breaking point is 14 pumps.

The image below shows the game interface.

You'll have 20 minutes to play. The time remaining is permanently displayed on the yellow strip at the top.
Choose the number of pumps to try by moving the "smiley" in the slider, or enter the number manually in the space below the slider. The minimum number of pumps you can enter is 1, and the maximum number is indicated to the right of the slider (for the example in the image, the maximum is 20). If you enter a number lower than 1 or higher than the maximum indicated, you won't be able to validate it.
Confirm your chosen number by pressing "TRY" to see the result of your choice. A short video will announce the result.

There are three possible results:
-	The balloon is **under-inflated**: this means that the balloon has not reached the breaking point. It can still be inflated.

-	The balloon has **burst**: this means you've passed the balloon's breaking point. You need to try a smaller number of push-ups.

-	The balloon is **inflated to its breaking point**: this means that you have found the balloon's breaking point.

Finding the breaking point of a ball earns you 1 point. Note that if you validate the correct result, you get the point even if the result video has not finished playing.
This means that if the game ends while the video is playing and the number entered was the solution, you get the point.
